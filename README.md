## General info
The program takes a PNG, JPG or JPEG image and uses visual cryptography to encrypt: it creates two new images that consist of seemingly random black and white pixels. The program can then take those two images and combine them together to form a black and white version of the original image
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.9
## Use
To use this project, download the project files, install the required dependencies and run main.py. You will be presented with a menu. To encrypt an image, first input 1 and then input the full name of the file you want to encrypt (e.g. example.png). Two new images will be created in your project directory. To decrypt them, input 2 in the main menu, input the full name of the first image and then input the full name of the second image. A new image will be created in your project directory: a black and white version of the original image
